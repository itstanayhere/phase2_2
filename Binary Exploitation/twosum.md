Following is the source code:

Now, since there is no way possible we can have such mathematically positive numbers, I assumed that the binary of the numbers must have been being added together. In 32 bit architecture, if the msb is 0, it means that the number is positive, while if it is 1 then the number is negative.

Exploiting this property,

This is because:
2,147,483,647 in decimal, is 01111111111111111111111111111111
And 1 is 01

Adding both these together, we get 10000â€¦..

This satisfies the condition, and we have our flag.
