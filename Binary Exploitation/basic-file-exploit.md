In the question its given as a hit that we can pass something the program is not expecting such as a string or character in place of a number.

Clearly, we canâ€™t do that here, so lets enter some data and give a prompt as a parameter in a place where a number has to be entered.

In the piece of code corresponding to number 2, we can enter numbers again in the program at the start. Plus here we see a statement for puts(flag).

That is what we do.
